### Highlighted Projects

- [**Spell Checker System**](https://github.com/verazi/Spell-Checker-System) [*Tech: C/C++, OpenMP, MPI, Spartan HPC*]
  1. Parallelized distinct word extraction from large-scale text documents using **OpenMP**, achieving speedup of 6 times. (see Dictionary repository: [Efficient Dictionary](https://github.com/verazi/Efficient-Dictionary))
  2. Implemented a distributed candidate generation pipeline using **MPI**, enabling scalable spell checking across multiple nodes, achieving speedup of 22 times.  
  3. Conducted systematic experiments to analyze **speedup, scalability, and memory utilization**. (see [Dictionary Report](https://github.com/verazi/Efficient-Dictionary/blob/main/Report1.pdf), [Spell Checker System Report](https://github.com/verazi/Spell-Checker-System/blob/main/Report.pdf))

- [**Cloud-Based Housing Affordability from Social Media**](https://github.com/verazi/Cloud-Based-Housing-Affordability-from-Social-Media) [*Tech: Python, Jupyter, Kubernetes, Fission, Kibana, Elasticsearch, NeCTAR Research Cloud*]
    1. Implemented serverless data analytics pipeline on cloud for scalable ingestion and processing of social media data from Reddit and Mastodon under API rate limits
    2. Provided real-time querying and exploratory analysis through RESTful APIs and interactive Kibana dashboards.

- [**Distributed Bank System Snapshot**](https://github.com/verazi/venkatesans-incremental-snapshot-bank-system) [*Tech: Python socket, select, JSON-based snapshot recovery, spanning tree coordination*] <br >
Implemented **Venkatesan’s incremental snapshot algorithm** in a Python-based distributed banking system with TCP sockets. Captures globally consistent states with minimized control messages and full crash recovery support. <br >

- [**Human vs Machine Text Classifier**](https://github.com/jqama/COMP90051-StatML-Group23) [*Tech: PyTorch, BCEWithLogitsLoss, weighted loss*]  <br >
Developed a 4-layer neural network with 17K-dimensional input to classify AI-generated vs. human-written text across imbalanced domains. Achieved **96.5% accuracy** and **0.82 macro-F1**, outperforming BERT by 7.7%. <br >
