## Hi, this is Vera 👋

I’m an IT graduate from the University of Melbourne, with a strong focus on High Performance Computing and Statistical Machine Learning.

## 🚀 High Performance & Distributed Systems Projects
**Spell Checker System**
  - Parallelized large-scale word extraction using OpenMP, achieving up to 6× speedup. see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/Efficient-Dictionary) & [Report](https://github.com/verazi/Efficient-Dictionary/blob/main/Report1.pdf)
  - Designed a distributed candidate generation pipeline with MPI, achieving 22× speedup. see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/Spell-Checker-System) & [Report](https://github.com/verazi/Spell-Checker-System/blob/main/Report.pdf)

**Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network**
  - Deployed deep CNN on FPGA to accelerate low-resolution to high-resolution image reconstruction. see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/SRCNN)

**Cloud-Based Housing Affordability from Social Media**
  - Built a serverless cloud analytics pipeline to ingest and analyze large-scale Reddit and Mastodon data. see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/Cloud-Based-Housing-Affordability-from-Social-Media)
  - Integrated CI/CD (GitLab) for automated deployment and scalable data processing
 
**Distributed Bank System Snapshot**
  - Implemented Venkatesan’s incremental snapshot algorithm to capture globally consistent states with minimized control messages and full crash recovery. see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/venkatesans-incremental-snapshot-bank-system)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Projects
**Human vs Machine Text Classifier**
  - Developed a 4-layer neural network with 17K-dimensional input to classify AI-generated vs. human-written text across imbalanced domains, achieving **96.5%** accuracy and **0.82** macro-F1. see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/AI-ML-Text-Detector)

**Voice-based querying of social media data collections using the MCP and LLM**
  - Built a voice-based querying system connecting APIs and LLMs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language access to social media data collections with LLM-based reasoning summaries  . see [Repository](https://github.com/verazi/Voice-Enabled-LLM-MCP-Reasoning-System)
